    <h1>Airsoft</h1>
    <h2>what is airsoft?</h2>
    <p>Airsoft is a team game in which participants eliminate opposing players by tagging them out of play with spherical plastic projectiles shot with mock air weapons called airsoft guns.

        Although similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not leave visible markings on their target and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets leave bruises or welts on exposed skin<br>
        (and so protective gear is recommended), the game relies heavily on an honor system in which players who have been hit are expected to call themselves out</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Here is a little more about it</h2>
        

        <div class ="pback">
            <p>Airsoft is a military simulation sport where players participate in mock combat with authentic military-style weapons and tactics. Unlike paintball, airsoft uses 6mm round BBs made of hard plastic. The guns used are full scale replicas of real world weapons.<br>

The guns used can be categorized into three main types: Spring powered, gas (CO2, green gas), and automatic electric guns (AEGs). Spring powered must be hand-cocked every time before shooting. They also shoot a lower velocity than gas or AEG guns.<br>
 Gas powered guns can use different gases to power them such as CO2 canisters, green gas, or propane. An Automatic Electric Guns is a gun, most often in rifle style, that uses a battery and motor to power the spring mechanism. VIP Airsoft uses these types of guns for their rentals as they are more reliable and easier for new players to use.
